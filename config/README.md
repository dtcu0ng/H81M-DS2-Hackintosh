## Config

This directory contain config.plist file required for booting OpenCore.

### How to use

+ From 0.7.4, I've added 'config_igpu.plist' with EFI (default booting config is 'config.plist' - that's for dGPU Hackintosh machine).
+ If you using iGPU, you should delete the default one (config.plist) and rename 'config_igpu.plist' to 'config.plist' before booting OpenCore.
